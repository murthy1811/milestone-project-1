## Developer and Business stories

* Clearly planned programming is done that leaves developers to improve the application further, easily and flexibly.
* A project which has lot of scope to make improvements further in the future.

## Strategy

### User Needs.

User should access the website on all devices and should be easy enough to navigate and get all the info needed

#### Technical limitations

Current project is only designed to be static. There is lot of scope to improve the content and features. For example, after the user registers oneself, there can be detailed information popped out
like when and where he can be vaccinated. This is out of scope for current Milestone 1 project. Only HTML and CSS are used.



## Scope

To attract lot of traffic and get registrations,  as the District Government body goal is to vaccinate as many people as they can. It is important to get all social media links function properly 
and to reach wider audience, everything should be smoother and simpler.

## Structure

With a welcoming text of explaining what this website is about and navigation links to Registration, contact and all latest press releases about COVID-19, site is designed 
to let user act upon quickly. Main page should be able to address the simple concerns of the user on how the vaccine works and if it is safe. 

The registration page should warn the user on, when can he expect the vaccine and how the information will reach him. 

Contact page should provide all the ways, apart from Social media( which is in Footer) and means of reaching the authorities on concerns, and queries.

The physical location should be there on main page as well, to direct the users if they want to talk to someone directly

Footer contains the social media info.

# Technologies Used

- HTML5

- Bootstrap v4.3.1
- Google Chrome Dev tools for debugging
- Google Light house for audits
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com) The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

# Testing

### Planning

Plan is to test the site manually and using the Google Lighthouse to evaluate the overall performance and chrome devtools to test each layout.

Devices tested for responsive design are iphone5/SE, iphone6/7/8/plus, Ipad, ipadpro, Galaxy S5

Screen testing done for the screens 24" computer screen (1920 x 1080), Laptop 14".

### Implementation

Plan is to test the site based on user stories. If the user stories are working as per the intention on all devices , then the testing is 
successful. Identified challenges and bugs while writing the code and how this is solved is writtten in bugs section.

I used devtools many times to test the intention, and if it does not work out, I tried to adjust the code in devtools and achieved the 
intended result by copying the changed code to the html files.

I used Lighthouse to check if the best practices are used or not. Initially I am not sure how to improve the results but tried to 
use google and made changes in the code to achieve the better results.

### Results 

There were troubles intially to make the navbar toggler icon work in mobiles. I slowly studied the navbar classes functioning in Bootstrap
and override the classes and adjusted to my requirments and achieved the intended results. Again, many times devtools are a great help.

Noticed several errors of sizing fonts to the responsive design and fixed them by writing responsive design in CSS


### Deployment

The current deployment of this project is done using gitpod.

Code is written in gitpod interface. git commands - add, commit, push are of great help

The deployed website is hosted on github pages for easy viewing without having to clone or fork the repository to view the running website.
Deployment was done by clicking on the settings tab on my repository then navigating to "Github pages"
Changing the source from none to master, this then deployed a link that can be found here : https://nemixu.github.io/Milestone1/
