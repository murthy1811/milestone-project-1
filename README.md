# UX

## Organisational stories

The organisation, Västra Götaland - Regional district government body wants 

1. To reach as many users as they can, by get registrations for vaccination.
2. To give clear information of COVID-19 vaccine safety.
3. To make sure that the user receives the information on when he can get vaccinated.

## Developer and Business stories

* Clearly planned programming is done that leaves developers to improve the application further, easily and flexibly.
* A project which has lot of scope to make improvements further in the future.

## Strategy

### User Needs.

User should access the website on all devices and should be easy enough to navigate and get all the info needed

#### Technical limitations

Current project is only designed to be static. There is lot of scope to improve the content and features. For example, after the user registers oneself, there can be detailed information popped out
like when and where he can be vaccinated. This is out of scope for current Milestone 1 project. Only HTML and CSS are used.



## Scope

To attract lot of traffic and get registrations,  as the District Government body goal is to vaccinate as many people as they can. It is important to get all social media links function properly 
and to reach wider audience, everything should be smoother and simpler.

## Structure

With a welcoming text of explaining what this website is about and navigation links to Registration, contact and all latest press releases about COVID-19, site is designed 
to let user act upon quickly. Main page should be able to address the simple concerns of the user on how the vaccine works and if it is safe. 

The registration page should warn the user on, when can he expect the vaccine and how the information will reach him. 

Contact page should provide all the ways, apart from Social media( which is in Footer) and means of reaching the authorities on concerns, and queries.

The physical location should be there on main page as well, to direct the users if they want to talk to someone directly

Footer contains the social media info.

- Bootstrap v4.3.1
- Google Chrome Dev tools for debugging
- Google Light house for audits
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com) The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

# Testing

### Planning

Plan is to test the site manually and using the Google Lighthouse to evaluate the overall performance and chrome devtools to test each layout.

Devices tested for responsive design are iphone5/SE, iphone6/7/8/plus, Ipad, ipadpro, Galaxy S5

Screen testing done for the screens 24" computer screen (1920 x 1080), Laptop 14".

The entire code is checked in validators and errors identified are solved and explained in bugs section

Browsers tested are Microsoft Edge, and Google Chrome.

### Implementation

Plan is to test the site based on user stories. If the user stories are working as per the intention on all devices , then the testing is 
successful. Identified challenges and bugs while writing the code and how this is solved is writtten in bugs section.

I tested if i can navigate to all required pages to fulfill the user story on all devices using devtools.

I tested if i can able to call and email through the website as per user story

I tested if the information regarding the vaccine is visible and readable to the user on all devices

I made sure on registration page, a simple query is asked if an user is registering for himself or someone else. and is seen in all devices.

I made sure the information regarding when one can get vaccinated on home page as well as on registration page, which is basically information
 that authorities will reach the user soon after registration.

I made sure all the links regarding the latest news are working on all devices and are opening in new tabs.

I tested all social media links are working on all devices.

I used devtools many times to test the intention, and if it does not work out, I tried to adjust the code in devtools and achieved the 
intended result by copying the changed code to the html files.

I used Lighthouse to check if the best practices are used or not. Initially I am not sure how to improve the results but tried to 
use google and made changes in the code to achieve the better results.

### Results 

There were troubles intially to make the navbar toggler icon work in mobiles. I slowly studied the navbar classes functioning in Bootstrap
and override the classes and adjusted to my requirments and achieved the intended results. Again, many times devtools are a great help.

Noticed several errors of sizing fonts to the responsive design and fixed them by writing responsive design in CSS

Intial score of the site from google light house is as below

Performance : 84% , Accesibility : 93%, Best practices :87% SEO: 90%

Final score after optimization like resizing images, adding rel=noopener attribute to the a tags with target=_blank, and also added meta description

Performance : 89% , Accesibility : 93%, Best practices :93% SEO: 100%

## Bugs

1. First hurdle in developing this site came to me to fit in the logo of vastra gotaland. The image is unable to adjust to the responsive design
   for different devices. Rather than writing more code in html, I choose to take the logo as background and adjust for different screens using
   bootstrap and called media queries for different screen sizes

2. Further, this gave me trouble in while coding for toggler icon for mobiles. The toggler icon  while expanding, the menu items were floating to 
   left and overflowed out of screen. By writing the correct code for bootstrap for navbar and adjusting classes I managed to solve this.
   I used more classes like mr-auto, mr-2 and navbar-collapse class width is adjusted to suit the needs.

3. I noticed after coding, that Home menu is not visible on ipad. Then I wrote the media screen query (max-width: 992px) and (min-width: 768px)  for different screens, which involved
   ipad as well. This solved the issue.

4. Initially I want to the expanded menu on mobiles to occupy the space above hero image. I could not solve this first. Later, I managed to solve
    using stackoverflow.com website help by using fixed-top command in html but I noticed that instead of menu occupying above the image, it is clean to push the content down.
    So, later I kept the original code.

5. Images in info section of the index page, were distorted initially. During the mentor mid project review, a quick suggestion by mentor 
   solved this. I used object-fit in CSS to solve this.

6. Register button in Info section of index page initially do not have the link to open the register page. With a little search and help from
   w3schools.com , I updated the code and solved this. onclick="document.location='register.html' is added to the button element
   
7. Initially Logo is not linked to index page. A little check upon my code myself and adjusting the divs , and bootstrap classes solved this.

8. When Nav links highlighitng not worked, I noticed class active is missing and corrected in all pages as needed.

9. Register page is not properly aligned in mobile. As per mentor recommendation, I corrected the code by making a single form and keeping all labels
   and inputs in one form, and wrote the proper CSS code, alignment is achieved in mobile for registration.

10. Added telephone and email links in contact page by href=tel and href=mailto: options as per mentor recommendation

11. In location section, for index and contact pages, intially I used only h4 and h5 elements , and as per mentor recommendation , I changed it to h4 and properly

12. While code is checked in validators, there is an parse error and the same code is written again and deleted the old one. This solved the issue

13. Wrong usage of p element is identified when ul element is placed with in p. This error is fixed.
